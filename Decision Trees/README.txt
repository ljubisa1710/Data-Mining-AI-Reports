For each algorithm, we have it's corresponding folder in code.zip
We have the spamdata.data inside ./Data

In each folder we have the python file and its respective readme.txt

Simply run the python file for each algorithm,
    - It will output on the console as the program is running to update you on its progress.
    - It will create the corresponding graph images in a folder in the previous directory called graphs.
        - If graphs does not exist it will be made by the program.
        - Inside graphs will be a folder for the images made by the corresponding python file.
