Dependencies:

    TensorFlow
    scikit-learn
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

Functionality:

    The script loads a subset of the Fashion-MNIST dataset, focusing specifically on classes 5 and 7 for a binary classification task.
    It preprocesses the data, including normalization, reshaping, and the introduction of label noise.
    It conducts hyperparameter tuning on a neural network, considering various numbers of hidden layers, nodes per layer, and activation functions.
    Performs k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of different hyperparameter combinations.
    Generates and saves error plots which visualize the training and test errors against different configurations of nodes and activation functions.

Execution:
Execute the script in a Python environment using the command: python nn.py.

Output:

    Console logs providing detailed information on the progress of hyperparameter tuning, including the configurations tested and their corresponding validation scores.
    Error plots saved as PNG files, each illustrating the error rates for different neural network configurations, named according to their activation functions.
