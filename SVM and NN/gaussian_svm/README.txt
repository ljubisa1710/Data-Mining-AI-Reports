This script performs a search for the best parameters γγ and C for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Gaussian kernel on a subset of the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Dependencies:

    TensorFlow
    scikit-learn
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

Functionality:

    The script loads the Fashion-MNIST dataset and preprocesses it, focusing on binary classification between classes 5 and 7.
    It divides the dataset for cross-validation and performs a search over a range of γγ and C values to find the combination that gives the best classification accuracy.
    K-Fold cross-validation is applied to get average accuracy scores.
    The script calculates both training and testing errors for the best parameters.
    A plot is generated that visualizes the training and testing errors as functions of the scale parameter γγ.

Execution:

    Run the script in a Python environment by using the command python gaussian_svm.py.

Output:

    Text outputs indicating the progress and results of the cross-validation and parameter search in the console.
    A plot saved as 'gaussian_error_plot.png', visualizing the errors against the scale parameter γγ.
